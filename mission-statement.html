        <h1>Our Mission and Philosophy</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center">Here at Zion Lutheran School, our motto is "Live, Lead, Love, Learn." As a Christ-centered community, this means that we strive to:</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col" style="align-self: center">
                <h3>LIVE for Christ</h3>
                <p>Zion Lutheran Church and School preaches and teaches to live for Christ, who saves us by grace through faith in Him. Church services, youth Bible studies, acolyting, and assisting with communion are ways that students may build their own faith walk while serving others in the church and school community. Confirmation and religion classes are educational opportunities that students may build their own faith walk while being equipped to serve others in all aspects of life.</p>
                <p>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. (Ephesians 2:8-10)</p>

                <h3>LEAD a life of godliness, wellness, and integrity</h3>
                <p>With Christ as our example, Zion develops the whole student (social, emotional, academic and spiritual well-being) through Christian modeling, leadership opportunities, character education, and instruction rooted in Scripture. </p>
                <p>And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man. (Luke 2:52)</p>

                <p>Zion is a school that provides a safe, nurturing, and accepting environment by modeling the spirit of the words from Scripture in all that we do. The faculty and staff are committed in developing personal relationships with all students, enabling each one to feel loved and cared for.</p>
                <p>We love because He first loved us. (1 John 4:19)</p>

                <p>Students at Zion are equipped to live their lives in the pursuit of excellence, building upon the foundation of knowledge and understanding of God's love for them. This intentional, spiritual development in an exceptional, academic setting allows students to grow not only in knowledge but also in wisdom.</p>
                <p>Let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance. (Proverbs 1:5)</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to Zion Lutheran School! </p>
                <p>I understand that any decision about your child’s education is an important one, and we appreciate the fact that you recognize Zion as a quality school for your consideration.</p>
                <p>Zion is an academically rigorous Christian private school in San Francisco that offers the necessary support so that students can achieve their fullest potential. In addition to following the California state educational standards, our school utilizes the Core Knowledge Sequence, which is a research-based curriculum that answers the call for academic excellence and higher literacy with its solid, specific, integrated core curriculum that establishes a strong educational foundation for our students.  </p>
                <p>Our well-rounded curriculum includes art, music, physical education, integrated technology education, and foreign language in addition to the core subject areas.  We provide limited class sizes so that our teachers and administration can provide individual attention to our students and their families.   With strong academics and a spiritual foundation, our graduates are well-prepared for their high school experiences.</p>
                <p>I look forward to having the opportunity to partner with you on your child’s behalf.  The staff and I are here to serve you.  You are important to us, and we are openly available to you should you have any further questions.  I would love to have you make an appointment for a personal tour of our facility so that you can familiarize yourself with our school and meet teachers and staff.  I look forward to seeing you soon!</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px">Blessings,</p>

# Zion Website Redesign
This file contains all the code regarding the re-creation of Zion Lutheran's website.

## Why
Having been an alumni of this school and having a passion for working in both education
and frontend, I decided to combine both of my passions to redesign their website. I decided
solely to do this as a passion project, as I have little experience in frontend and
need experience and familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## What Changed
The website has a full re-design, with a focus on a simplistic design that would illustrate
the best points that the school has to offer.
One of the most difficult points to re-design was the homepage, as instead of a wordy 
title page, I wanted to create a homepage with snap-scrolling. Though this took several
hours to implement, the final product is as such:
